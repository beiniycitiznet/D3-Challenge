          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <br>
          <h5>Lacks of Healthcare vs. Poverty</h5>
          <p>According to the graph, we can see that when the percentage of population in poverty increases, lacks of healthcare 
            percentage also increase. This might be caused by the high-priced healthcare in the US. Most people cannot afford the 
            healthcare they need when they are sick or injured without an insurance, and most people also cannot afford the costly 
            insurance without an employer or government's support. Another observation is that there is a higher poverty percentage 
            in the Southeastern states. Hopefully these states' government will start taking actions to help people who are in poverty.
          </p>
          <h5>Smoking Percentage vs. Household Income</h5>
          <p>According to the graph, people with lower household income has a higher chance to smoke. This might be becuase people with
            a lower income might be more stressed out on cost of living, and cigarette substitutes are more expensive than cigarette since
            they are typically healther. People with higher income tend to care about their health more than how much money they will have 
            to spend on maintaining their health. 
          </p>

          <h5>Obesity vs. Household Income</h5>
          <p>According to the graph, people with lower household income has a higher chance of being overweight. This might be caused by
            price of fast foods compare to healthy foods. As we know, healthy foods like salad are typically more expensive than fast food 
            we can get from McDonalds. People with lower household income are less wiilling to pay for expensive healthy foods than people
            with higher income.
